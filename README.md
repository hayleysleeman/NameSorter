NameSorter Coding Assessment

This C# program sorts a list of names read from a text file and outputs the sorted names to a new file.
The text file path to read must be provided as a command line argument when running the program.
Example: "name-sorter.exe names.txt"

Given a set of names, it should order that set first by last name, then by any given names the person may have. A name must have at least 1 given name
and may have up to 3 given names.
